### The Structure of the eye 
The eye is really a wonder of nature, so perfect it works, and I am going to start my new journey studying a bit about this beaitufil machine. How humans percieve
vision will tell is of a great interest to us. The human eye has 3 membrane structure, one of them is retina, which forms the part of the eye where the images are 
formed inside the eye. It percieves this image and sends the signal to the brain (how brilliant). 

It has two types of receptors, cones and rods.
