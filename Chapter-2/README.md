### The Structure of the eye 
The eye is really a wonder of nature, so perfect it works, and I am going to start my new journey studying a bit about this beautiful machine. How humans percieve
vision is of a great interest to us. The human eye has 3 membrane structure, one of them is retina, which forms the part of the eye where the images are 
formed inside the eye. It percieves this image and sends the signal to the brain (how brilliant). 

It has two types of receptors, cones and rods. Cones are sensitive to the color and focus on the high level features. The vision related to cones is known as  **photopic vision**. 

Rods capture overall image of the field of view. They capture the low level features. This type of vision is known as **scotopic vision**. 

"Objects that appear colored during the day, appear as colorless forms in the moonlight" and now you know why, because for the latter, only the rods are stimulated.
